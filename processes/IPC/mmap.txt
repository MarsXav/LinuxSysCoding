1. Can we ++ return value of mmap? after doing so, can we munmap it?
void *ptr = mmap(...);
Yes, we can, but not suggested. munmap cannot be achieved, address must be cached

2. When open with O_RDONLY, if mmap with PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, what will hapen?
Error, return MAP_FAILED. open() limit is suggested to be aligned with mmap's limit.

3. What will happen if offset is set 1000?
Offset must be integer times 4k. Return MAP_FAILED

4. When will mmap fail
	length = 0;
	prot: PROT_WRITE only; limits differs from open()

5. Can we create a new file with open(..,O_CREAT)?
Yes, but the size of the file cannot be 0. Operations like lseek/truncate can be used

6. What will happen if close(fd) after mmap?
Nothing will happen, mapping area still exists, only fd closes.

7. What will happen if we operate ptr with exceeded limit?
void *ptr = mmap(NULL, 100000,,,);
