Characteristics of pipes

	Pipes are buffers in kernal memory
	Pipes have characteristics of files
	One pipe is a byte stream
	Data transfer is unidirectional
	annonymous pipes can only use in processes with common ancestors

Read pipe:
	When has data in pipe, read returns bytes read
	When no data in pipe, read returns 0
	When write end is not fully closed, read blocked and wait
Write pipe:
	When read ends all close, process abord and reeives SIGPIPE
	When read ends not fully closed,
		when pipe is full, write blocks
		when pipe not full, returns bytes input
